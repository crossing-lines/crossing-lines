<h2>Who am I?</h2>
<p>Well, this blog really wouldn't be an anonymous blog if I told you exactly who I am.  But I can tell you a little <em>about</em> me.  I tend to like a lot of stereotypical girly things.  Sparkly, shiny things make me happy.  I love looking at long, elegant dresses.  I like dressing up.  I like it when I get to dye my hair a new color—it makes me feel like a new person (and, most of the time, pretty).  I like cute nail polish designs, pencil skirts, bright eye makeup, the color pink, ballet flats, spunky heels, and skinny jeans.  Oh yeah, and I have a penis.</p>
<p>That's what makes me and this blog different from a teenage girl babbling on about her latest crush or the newest fashion trends:  I was born, still am, and probably always will be biologically male.  I'm also a Christian—though my views on a lot of things are not what you'd think.  My relationship with religion is complicated and probably best left to blog posts about the topic.  If that wasn't different enough for you, I'm also married.  Happily.  To a woman.  I am madly in love with my wife, and she means the world to me.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="what-is-crossing-lines">
<h2>What is Crossing Lines?</h2>
<p>This blog is about both of those first two paragraphs.  Some of it is me expressing my feminine side; in a nutshell, it's me pretending to be a girl.  That's the way I was feeling when I designed the background and look of this blog (based on the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/waterspill-en">waterspill-en</a> theme for <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/">Pelican</a>).  If you're not interested in that part (which I don't really know why you would be), skip those posts.  But you might get something that may help you grasp the second part of the blog—the part about being a married, Christian male who is struggling through all of this.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-name-of-the-blog">
<h3>The Name of the Blog</h3>
<p>At least one meaning of the name &quot;Crossing Lines&quot; should be pretty obvious at this point, but let me go through all of them just in case you missed it.  The most obvious meaning is that this is a blog about gender lines and the crossing of them.  But it's also about crossing conversational barriers—talking about things people don't want to bring up, particularly in the Christian church.  Finally, the &quot;cross&quot; is not an accident:  Christianity is an important element of my life, and it's an important element of this blog.  It won't always be in-your-face.  Sometimes, it will be the main topic of a post.  But more often, it'll just be the background noise that explains implicitly why I think the way I do.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-c-word">
<h3>The &quot;C&quot; Word</h3>
<p>I don't want to scare people away from this blog my overemphasizing my religious background.  Even if you're not a Christian, you may find that I think about things in much the same way that you do.  If you've read this far on this page, you might need to read this blog as much as I need to write it.  What I'm saying is this:  Don't let the Christianity part scare you off.  It's probably not what you think it is, anyway.</p>
<p>But since a lot of people who struggle with the same issues I do have been badly hurt by Christians in the past, many of you may have a mental block against anything that uses the &quot;C&quot; word.  That's okay, I understand.  Posts tagged with &quot;C-word free&quot; are for you.  I'll also tag some posts with &quot;for the church.&quot;  These are more for people who are specifically immersed in the Christian church or have been in the past.  If you're not a Christian, but not specifically offended by Christianity, these posts may not make sense to you, even though the rest of the blog should be just fine.</p>

<div class="section" id="why-be-anonymous">
<h2>Why be Anonymous?</h2>
<p>A lot of people, particularly &quot;out-of-the-closet&quot; transgendered people, will criticize me for keeping my identity to myself.  But most of these people, if they think about it for a bit, will also agree it's not that simple.  Though I haven't been formally diagnosed, I'm pretty sure I have <a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_disorder">gender identity disorder (GID)</a>.  I don't know where my GID will take me in the future.  Perhaps one day I'll feel comfortable associating my real-world identity with this blog.  But for now, being anonymous makes me free to express how I really feel without thinking about what people I know will think if they read it.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-do-this">
<h2>Why do this?</h2>
<p>This blog is first and foremost for me.  I have so many thoughts and tensions in my head that I have to get them out somewhere.  If no one reads it, it will still serve a purpose.  But I honestly hope that someone in my sort of situation does read this.  I know enough to know that I'm not the only one like me.  If you're out there reading this, I want you to know that you're not alone either.</p>
<p>I don't have all the answers.  Sometimes it feels like I don't have any.  Some posts on this blog will have a question mark at the end of just about every sentence.  But this is what I've got, and I hope you'll read it and find it helpful.</p>
